## Set Up and Dependencies 

  - Java JDK

  - Node JS & NPM
    - Please install from here https://nodejs.org/en/
  - Android Studio & Emulators

 ## Set Up 2 virtual devices
 
  - From the Android Studio main screen, go to `Tools -> AVD Manager.`
  - Press the "+ Create Virtual Device" button.
  
  - Choose the type of hardware you'd like to emulate. We recommend testing against a variety of devices, but if you're unsure where to start, the newest device in     the Pixel line could be a good choice.
  - Select an OS version to load on the emulator (probably one of the system images in the "Recommended" tab), and download the image.
  - Change any other settings you'd like, and press "Finish" to create the virtual device. You can now run this device anytime by pressing the Play button in the       AVD Manager window.
